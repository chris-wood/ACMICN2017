Each accepted paper, poster, and demo must be presented by one of its author(s) at the ICN conference.
The author must register for the corresponding event according to his/her membership and status: e.g., for a student author presenting a paper, poster, or demo, he/she only needs to register under the student category.
We do not require a full-rate registration for each paper.

<p>
The Conference Organizing Committee is working to provide as much travel support to as many conference attendees as possible. For this year we have two kinds of travel support: the ACM SIGCOMM GeoDiversity travel grants and the ICN'17 student travel grants.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>ACM SIGCOMM GeoDiversity travel grants</b> are available for attendees in their early career from under-represented countries, based on need, distance to the conference venue, and impact of their attendance in increasing the diversity of conference participation.

      <h3>All Details</h3>

      <h4>Who Should Apply?</h4>
      <p>
      Because the intent of the grants is to increase participation from countries historically under-represented at SIGCOMM sponsored conferences (e.g. Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia), applicants should be from such countries. Applicants should be in their early career (at most five years of full-time, full-level [non-postdoc] post-PhD employment), and may be graduate students or post-docs. The precise amount of funding available and the pool of applicants will determine who can be funded.
      </p>
      <p>
      The committee strongly prefers applicants who are not paper authors (the committee believes that authors' home organizations should cover costs for authors). Poster authors, however, are encouraged to apply. Other evaluation criteria will include evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by project experience. In most cases, no more than one applicant will be funded from each organization. ACM-ICN encourages participation of women and under-represented minorities.
      </p>

      <h4>What is Covered?</h4>
      <p>
      Support is intended to fully cover travel (economy airfare), registration for the conference, lodging at a hotel, meals, and local transportation. The specific costs will vary for each applicant, and are not expected to exceed $3500 for junior faculty, or $3000 for students. Reimbursement details will be announced to award recipients.

      <h3>All Details</h3>

      <h4>Who Should Apply?</h4>
      <p>
      Any full-time student registered toward a Bachelors, Masters, or Ph.D. degree in a college or university when submitting the application can apply for the ICN'17 student travel grants.
      </p>

      <h4 >What is Covered?</h4>
      <p>
      The level of support provided will depend on the finances of the conference and the needs of each award recipient. The level of support and the reimbursement details will be announced to award recipients.
      </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
The application requirements and the level of support depend on the type of grant, as explained above. The remaining information is common to both types of grant.

<h3 class="hcls">Selection Criteria</h3>
                                                                     
<p>The following criteria will be used in the selection process:</p>

* Preference will be given to applicants that do not present a paper in the conference. The
  rationale for this criterion is that the participation costs for a presenting author should be
  covered by their home institution.

* Students presenting posters are encouraged to apply though. The rationale is to support the
  participation of students who do not present papers but contribute to the conference in other
  ways.

* Evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project
  experience, will be required. Advanced students close to graduation or in the job market will
  also be given priority, when possible.

* We also encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities. Special
  attention will be given to applicants from minority-serving institutions.

* After giving priority to the above criteria, (co-)authors of papers may be considered but will
  be given lower priority.

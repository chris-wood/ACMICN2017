## Submission and Publication Compliance Policies

Papers submitted for consideration must not have been already published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the consideration period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy) and the [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions).

Like other conferences and journals, ICN prohibits violation of the above ACM Policies and may take action against authors who violate them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the compliance of papers under consideration. If the TPC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.

ICN will review extended versions of previously-published short preliminary papers (such as workshop papers) in accordance with published [ACM SIGCOMM](http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/) policies. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be considered.

Papers must be written in English. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through a single-blind reviewing process. Authors must identify themselves by name and affiliation in the title of the paper.

Submissions can be made through HotCRP: please go to the ICN 2017 Submission Site at [https://icn17.hotcrp.com/](https://icn17.hotcrp.com/).

## Conflicts of interest

Both authors and TPC members must identify conflicts of interest according to the following general principles.

A program committee member (including the chairs of the committee) is considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission that has an author in any of the following categories: the person himself or herself; a past or current student or academic advisor; a supervisor or employee in the same line of authority within the past four years; a member of the same organization (e.g., company, university, government agency, etc.) within the past four years or in the near future (six months); a co-author of a paper appearing in publication within the past four years; someone with whom there has been a financial relationship (e.g., grants, contracts, consultancies, equity investments, stock options, etc.) within the past four years; someone with whom acceptance or rejection would further the personal goals of the reviewer (e.g., a competitor); a member of the same family or anyone considered a close personal friend; or someone about whom, for whatever reason, their work cannot be evaluated objectively. If there is no basis for the TPC conflicts provided by authors, however, those conflicts will be removed. Do not improperly indicate conflicts simply to prevent some TPC members from reviewing your paper.

## Formatting Requirements

All submissions must obey the formatting requirements listed below. Your goal as an author is to produce a clearly readable submission within these constraints. The TPC chairs may immediately reject submissions that violate the formatting requirements. The submission system can report some formatting violations in papers that you upload. You can also visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using this [online tool](http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sigops/banal/index2.php). The formatting of the final published papers may vary slightly (e.g., regarding page numbering). Precise formatting instructions for finalized papers will be made available to the authors after the acceptance notification.

For your submission, please follow the rules:

- Submit papers of no more than ten (10) single-spaced pages, including figures, tables, references, appendices, etc. Papers longer than 10 pages will not be reviewed. For posters and demos the page limit is 2 pages.
- Include names and affiliations of all authors in the title page, as the review process will be single-blind.
- Submit papers using formatted for printing on Letter-sized paper (8.5" by 11").  Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25" by 3.33", 0.33" space between columns.  Each column must contain no more than 55 lines of text.  For submission, use [2017 ACM Article template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template){: rel="external"} ([LaTeX](http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart.zip){: rel="external"}, [MS Word/Windows](http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acm_windows_word_template.zip){: rel="external"}, [MS Word/Mac](http://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acm_mac_2011_word_template.zip){: rel="external"}).

    If you are using LaTeX, you can make use of [this template for ACM conference proceedings](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template).  Unlike the official template, it only includes example for the ACM conference proceedings.
    {: class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" }

- Provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
- Number the pages.
- Submit papers in PDF (Portable Document Format) and ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Other formats, including Postscript, will not be accepted. Avoid using any special characters or non-standard fonts. We must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest that you use only standard fonts embedded in the PDF file.
- Ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible, including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc.
- Limit the file size to less than 15MB. Contact the TPC chairs if you have a file larger than 15 MB.

## Paper Acceptance

The ICN 2017 TPC will notify authors of review decisions by July 18, 2017. The authors of accepted papers must then prepare and submit the final version of their papers (“camera-ready”) by August 21, 2017.

The TPC may assign a shepherd, chosen among the members of the TPC, to guide the authors through the preparation of the final version of their papers. In this case, the authors should plan to interact with their shepherds immediately after notification, and to budget sufficient time between the notification date (July 18, 2017) and the camera-ready deadline (August 21, 2017) to address the reviewers’ comments in coordination with their shepherd. The final version of the paper must be approved by the assigned shepherd. Conflicts will be mediated by the TPC chairs.

The publisher of the SIGCOMM proceedings will review all finalized papers and may request formatting changes. Authors should budget sufficient time immediately after the August 21, 2017 deadline to respond as quickly as possible to such requests by the publisher. Significant and substantive changes made after acceptance, particularly to paper titles, must be approved by the shepherd (if applicable) and the TPC chairs. In addition, only in exceptional circumstances should authors change their author list, and only with the approval of the shepherd (if applicable) and the TPC chairs.

Authors of accepted papers will also need to sign an ACM copyright release form. Electronic copies of the papers will be published on the conference Web site before the conference, unless authors specifically request otherwise. All rejected papers will be permanently treated as confidential.

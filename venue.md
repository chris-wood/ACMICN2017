The building opened its doors for the public on September 13th, 1913.
There are a veritable host of stories around this place.
It is mentioned in the famous novel <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i> by Alfred D&ouml;blin.
The German illustrator and photographer Heinrich Zille had his regular place at the bar, where he used to sit and draw.
Otto Dix painted the poster for the place (1931), which is still used today.

After WWII, the mirrored ballroom remained closed.
It was reopened in January 2005.
All interior was left largely untouched.

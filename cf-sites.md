## {{ page.title }}

The Steering Committee of the ACM Information-Centric Networking is inviting
interested groups and individuals to submit proposals for hosting the 2018 ACM ICN
conference. After ACM ICN 2014 in Paris, ACM ICN 2015 in San Francisco, ACM ICN
2016 in Kyoto and ACM ICN 2017 in Berlin, we are especially interested in
proposals for hosting ACM ICN 2018 in (North) America (without excluding
proposals from other parts of the world).

Site proposals should include information regarding the following three items:

### A: City

The city should be located near a major international airport, within 1-2 hours of
regular train service and/or 45 minutes of cab/shuttle service. A major
international airport should have at least two airlines with regular international
service to the 3 major continents of ICN attendees: Asia, Europe, North America.

The proposed venue should have one conference meeting room that can accommodate
approximately 200 attendees (our current estimate), together with a few other
rooms for potential tutorials and/or workshops. The conference room should support
a single center screen or two side-by-side screens with unobstructed views. The
venues should include, or allow for rental of, equipment for Internet connectivity
for 200 attendees in the main conference hall and for multiple parallel demos.

The city should have hotels supporting 200-250 people (attendees and their guests)
within easy access (less than 15 minutes time, preferably at most 1
metro/bus/tram) to the venue.

The city should have potential venues for a reception and banquet dinner. A sample
list of possible venues with a 1-line description addressing logistics (time to
get there, need for transportation) would be useful.

### B. Conference General Chair & Organization Committee
The proposal should include
 *  the name and affiliation of a widely-recognized member of the networking
    community with ties to the proposed site city who is willing to serve as the
    General Chair, or up to 2 co-chairs with at least one of them local or with
    ties to the site.
 *  The names and affiliations of a few other candidates which the General Chair
    can enlist to serve on the organization committee, notably a local person as
    local arrangements chair, a publicity chair, and a treasurer, etc.
Optionally but desirably, the proposal may including an estimate cost for the
conference venue and the hotel price range.

NOTE: This site proposal should not suggest program committee chairs; which will
be appointed separately by the ACM ICN Steering Committee.

### C. Date conflicts
The conference is typically held between September 15 and October 15. Please
indicate which dates have major local conflicts, e.g., major local events, school
openings, etc. that would interfere with either the proposed site or the proposed
General Chair's participation.

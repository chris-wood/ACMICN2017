The organizing committee is delighted to invite you to submit your work for presentation at the 4th ACM conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2017), to be held in Berlin, Germany from September 26-28, 2017.

The fundamental concept in Information Centric Networking (ICN) is to provide the ability to access named information as a principal service offered by the network, evolving the Internet from today’s host based packet delivery towards directly retrieving information objects and invoking services by name in a secure, reliable, scalable, and efficient way. These architectural design efforts aim to address the challenges that arise from the increasing demands for highly scalable content distribution, from accessing cloud resources, from accelerated growth of mobile devices, from wide deployment of Internet-of-things (IoT), and from the need to secure the global Internet. Papers which reach out into related fields are specifically encouraged.

ACM ICN 2017 will be a single track conference focusing on current ICN research topics, featuring paper presentations, posters and demonstrations.

## Topics of Interest

- Use of ICN for both legacy problems and novel use cases, including but not limited to:
    - Content distribution
    - Name-based access to cloud resources
    - Device and content mobility
    - IoT
- Network layer, mobility and architecture:
    - Comparison of architectures, ICN styles and semantics
    - Interdependency of namespace design, routing, and resource control
    - ICN support for ad hoc and direct peer-to-peer communication
    - ICN for high-speed networking
- Operations:
    - Business and Economic models and their effects on deployability
    - Management of ICN networks and systems
    - Caching and its interaction with I/O performance
    - Scalability analysis
    - Traffic Engineering
- Security:
    - Privacy, both generally and especially its interaction with caching
    - Trust management and access control
    - IoT-specific security considerations
- Application layer, Evaluations and Testbeds:
    - APIs for transport, other higher-level abstractions, and their assessment
    - Experience from implementation, testbeds, and tools
    - Critical analysis of previous research in ICN, including reproducibility studies
    - Methodology and metrics
- Translational Research:
    - Deployments of ICN
    - ICN for distributed computation, cloud-based services, database queries, big data manipulation as well as ICN-mediated sensor/actuator control loops
    - ICN-inspired applications and systems
- Implementation challenges and experiences
    - Line speed caching
    - Routing scalability
    - Congestion control
    - Zero conf ICN

## Submission Details

Full-papers can be up to 10 pages in length, following the ACM SIGCOMM format, and should convey results of mature research. Short-papers can be up to 6 pages in length: This format is suitable for less mature workshop-oriented work not qualifying for a full submission and for thought-provoking position papers. Submissions exceeding the 6 pages length will be considered as full-papers. Papers with doctoral students as first authors are particularly encouraged. Note that in order to ensure adequate citation of related work, extra pages of references are allowed (and encouraged).

Submissions will be reviewed and evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference. A “best paper award” will be attributed from the program committee to one among the accepted papers in each of the Full paper and Short paper categories. The program committee may invite authors of non-accepted papers present their work with a poster accompanied by a 2-page extended abstract. Please note that ACM ICN 2017 also has a specific call for posters, demos, tutorials, and panel sessions.

To submit papers and abstracts to the ICN 2017 conference, first carefully read the [submission policies](http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2017/submission.html#policies), the [conflicts of interest](http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2017/submission.html#conflicts), and the [formatting requirements](http://conferences2.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2017/submission.html#formatting) specified below.

Submissions can be made through HotCRP: please go to the ICN 2017 Submission Site at (https://icn17.hotcrp.com/)[https://icn17.hotcrp.com/].

## Submission Instructions

- Register your paper by May 1, 2017 on the paper submission site. Submit your paper by May 8, 2017. Be sure to finalize your paper on the paper submission site to make it available for review.
- Submit your poster and demo abstract by July 8, 2017. Be sure to finalize your abstract on the submission site to make it available for review.

**This is a hard deadline, and no extensions will be given.**

**We use different submission sites for full papers and poster/demo abstracts.**

If your paper is accepted, we will provide further information for the camera-ready version.

If you have any questions about submitting papers to ICN 2017, or encounter problems with
the paper submission site, contact the TPC chairs well before the deadline.

## Important dates

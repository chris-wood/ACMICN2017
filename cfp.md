# Call for Papers

Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new network architecture intended to provide access to information without requiring an explicit binding of that information to a particular location. By directly addressing information, ICN supports mobile users and mobile networked devices, offers a higher-level communication service to applications, and promotes authentication and efficiency in the transmission and dissemination of information. Over the last few years, a global research and development community has grown around the idea of ICN.

ACM ICN 2017 is the second edition of the ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking, which follows a series of workshops on ICN held in conjunction with the ACM Sigcomm conference.  ACM ICN 2017 is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, and challenges in information centric networking.  ACM ICN 2017 will be a single-track conference featuring paper and poster presentations, panel discussions, and demonstrations.

The Technical Program Committee of ACM ICN 2017 invites high-quality submissions describing unpublished research results in all aspects of ICN, with particular emphasis on contributions to architectural designs and reproducible experimental evaluations.  Papers submitted for consideration should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the consideration period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism]{http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy} and the [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions]{http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions}.

Topics of interest include:

- Architecture design and evaluation
- Comparison of different ICN architectures
- Interoperability across ICN architectures
- ICN evaluation methodology and metrics
- Analysis of scalability issues in ICN
- ICN enabled applications
- Routing in ICN
- Transport issues in ICN
- Caching
- Mobility support
- Trust management and access control
- Management in ICN
- ICN economics and business models
- Tools, experimentation facilities, and measurement methodology for ICN
- Experience from implementation
- Feasibility studies of ICN for high speed networking
- Privacy
- ICN Deployment
- ICN APIs

In addition to the main conference, ACM ICN 2017 will have a series of co-located workshops, tutorials, poster and demo sessions, a travel grant program, and conference best paper(s) and SIGCOMM awards. For the criteria for the selection of the conference best paper award(s), see [Best Paper Award Guidelines](http://www.sigcomm.org/content/best-paper-award-guidelines).

## Submissions

<!-- SIGCOMM is a highly selective conference where full papers typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, deployment, simulation, or analysis. Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references. Detailed submission instructions can be found on the conference web site. -->

<!-- Detailed submission instructions can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/submission.html). -->

More information will be released soon.

<!-- ## Experience Track -->

â€¨<!-- In addition to submissions considered for the standard track, SIGCOMM 2017 will also include a submission category for experience papers on the design, analysis, and evaluation of techniques in commercial (or otherwise widespread) deployment. Authors must explicitly indicate whether a submission is to be considered for this track or the standard track. (Further information in the detailed submission instructions.) -->

<!-- ## Ethical Concerns -->

<!-- Authors must as part of the submission process attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient -- in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards. -->

<!-- ## Authors take note -->

<!-- The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two or three weeks prior to the first day of the conference and applies to all published work unless the authors explicitly opt out. Note that the official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. -->

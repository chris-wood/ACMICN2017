## {{ page.title }}

Following last yearâ€™s successful tutorials, ACM ICN 2017 solicits proposals for half- or full-day tutorials on topics relevant to the ICN research that can help the audience gain further understanding of this new and exciting area. In particular, we seek tutorials on intermediate and advanced topics of critical importance to the maturing ICN field (such as, but not limited to, applied cryptography, or technological advances for ICN, or application of ICN to specific fields such as IoT), offered through collaboration between ICN researchers and experts in other domains.

Tutorials may be lectures, hands-on training, or any combination of the above. Exploring diverse ways of interacting with the audience is welcome, as are cross-disciplinary topics. 

Tutorial proposals should be submitted in PDF format, not exceeding three (3) pages in total, and be sent to the workshop/tutorial chairs.

### Important note

Jon Crowcroft has been the Marconi Professor of Communications Systems
in the Computer Laboratory of University of Cambridge since October 2001. He has worked in the
area of Internet support for multimedia communications for over 30
years. Three main topics of interest have been scalable multicast
routing, practical approaches to traffic management, and the design of
deployable end-to-end protocols. Current active research areas are
Opportunistic Communications, Social Networks, and techniques and
algorithms to scale infrastructure-free mobile systems. He leans
towards a "build and learn" paradigm for research.
